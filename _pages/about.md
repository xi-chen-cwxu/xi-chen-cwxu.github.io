The research "Development of New Methods for Assessing the Quality and Effectiveness of Live Broadcasts Using Digital Human Technologies" pioneers a multidimensional evaluation framework that integrates technical performance metrics and audience psychological dynamics to redefine standards for virtual host-driven broadcasts. A groundbreaking contribution is the hierarchical assessment system, beginning with a technical quality module employing the Absolute Category Rating (ACR) method. Viewers rate broadcasts on a 1–5 scale, and the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is derived through the formula:

This quantifies broadcast fidelity while establishing correlations between technical stability (video/audio quality) and viewer satisfaction. Beyond hardware-centric metrics, the framework innovatively incorporates emotional resonance, social presence, and cognitive factors (e.g., self-efficacy, information overload), demonstrating that virtual hosts’ emotional expressiveness and interactivity amplify trust and community engagement. Additionally, the methodology bridges host attributes (realism, absence of humor) with audience-specific variables (cultural context, personal motivations), offering adaptive strategies to optimize authenticity. By unifying objective technical benchmarks with subjective human perceptions, this work sets a new paradigm for evaluating and enhancing digital human-mediated live streaming experiences.
