<br><i><b>Holosync：融合ACR-MOS指标、情感共鸣与文化自适应的人工智能数字人直播效能评估框架</b></i><br>
The research <i>"Development of New Methods for Assessing the Quality and Effectiveness of Live Broadcasts Using Digital Human Technologies" </i>pioneers a multidimensional evaluation framework that integrates technical performance metrics and audience psychological dynamics to redefine standards for virtual host-driven broadcasts. A groundbreaking contribution is the hierarchical assessment system, beginning with a technical quality module employing the Absolute Category Rating (ACR) method. Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is derived through the formula:

    <div style="margin: 4px; font-size: 1.2em;">
        The Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is calculated as:
        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 4px 0;">
            \[ MOS = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_i}{n} \]
        </div>
        where \( R_i \) = individual rating score, \( n \) = total number of viewers.
    </div>
</body>
</html>
This framework quantifies technical stability (video/audio quality) and viewer satisfaction correlations, while innovatively integrating <b>emotional resonance, social presence, and cognitive dynamics</b>. It bridges virtual hosts' attributes (realism, emotional expressiveness) with audience-specific variables (cultural context, motivations), establishing a new evaluation paradigm that unifies technical benchmarks with human-centric perceptions to optimize digital streaming authenticity.
